# A Regression model to predict the auction sales price of the bulldozers
> Predicting the Sales Price of Bulldozers using ML Model
> The goal of this project would be to predict the sales price of bulldozers using multiple Regression models.

# 1. Problem Definition
Predict the auction sale price for a piece of heavy equipment to create a "blue book" for bulldozers based on the previous datasets and for how much similar bulldozers have been sold for?

# 2. Data
The data is downloaded from Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition.

There are 3 main datasets. https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data

* Train.csv is the training set, which contains data through the end of 2011.
* Valid.csv is the validation set, which contains data from January 1, 2012 - April 30, 2012 You make predictions on this set throughout the majority of the competition. Your score on this set is used to create the public leaderboard.
* Test.csv is the test set, which won't be released until the last week of the competition. It contains data from May 1, 2012 - November 2012. Your score on the test set determines your final rank for the competition.
# 3. Evaluation
The evaluation metric for this competition is the RMSLE (root mean squared log error) between the actual and predicted auction prices.
